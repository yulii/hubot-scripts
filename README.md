This is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty cool.

### Testing Hubot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following.

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output about where your scripts come from and a
prompt.

    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading adapter shell
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/scripts
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/src/scripts
    Hubot>

Then you can interact with hubot by typing `hubot help`.

    Hubot> hubot help

    Hubot> animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds a few
    convert me <expression> to <units> - Convert expression to given units.
    help - Displays all of the help commands that Hubot knows about.
    ...


### Scripting

Take a look at the scripts in the `./scripts` folder for examples.
Delete any scripts you think are useless or boring.  Add whatever functionality you
want hubot to have. Read up on what you can do with hubot in the [Scripting Guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md).
